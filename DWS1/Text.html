		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
		<p>
			The giant squid <em>(genus: Architeuthis)</em> is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the <br /> 
			
			family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can <br /> 
			
			grow to a tremendous size <em>(see Deep-sea gigantism)</em>: recent estimates put the <br /> 
			
			maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the <br /> 
			
			posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles <em>(second only to the colossal <br /> 
			
			squid at an estimated 14 m  (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms)</em>. The <br />
			 
			mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long <em>(more for females, less for males)</em>, and the <br /> 
			
			length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of <br /> 
			
			specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.

			On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title = "Museum of Nature and Science"> NMNS </abbr> (Museum of Nature and Science)<br /> 
			
			of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title = "Ogasawara Whale Watching Association"> OWA</abbr> 
			
			(Ogasawara Whale Watching Association) took the first <br /> 
			
			images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 <br /> 
			
			photographs were released a year later. The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a <br /> 
			
			live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.
